# DeadBlock

A game inspired by another massive hit game called [Deadmind](https://github.com/olchyk98/deadmind). Created with hate to developers of [MonoGame](https://www.amazon.com/Island-Dogs-11814-Sack-Shit/dp/B00890O2WA) and [Unity](https://www.amazon.com/Island-Dogs-11814-Sack-Shit/dp/B00890O2WA), since those developres are just useless pieces of shit. This game uses only native API methods. Meaning, **it doesn't use Content Pipeline**.

Developed Architecture presented in the codebase is good. If you really think that this architecture is bad, probably you'll create the next unity. You'll get a lot of money and women. **The problem is** that you will die alone, knowing that you are just a [**piece of hardcore shit.**](https://www.php.net/)

## Code Style / Naming Conventions
*I was forced* to use code style created by my school. Honestly, it's... (you know where this is going). It consists of a few small things
that we [must] do:

### Using a/an/some in argument names

So let's say you have a method signature:

```private int Abs(int n);```

With this **beautiful code style** you will probably do it like that:

```private int Abs(int myN);```

_Absolutely in love with this [code style](https://www.amazon.com/Island-Dogs-11814-Sack-Shit/dp/B00890O2WA)!!11_

### Using "my" instead of "_"

Instead of regular private member names, we write something like `mySpriteButcher`, which actually kind of nice. The problem is that you should use the same naming convension with **internal** members, so now this [convention](https://www.amazon.com/Island-Dogs-11814-Sack-Shit/dp/B00890O2WA) is all around the code.

```internal IProcessShadow myProcessShadow;```

-----

With that said, it's a really good code style (no), and I'm going to use it in my future projects (no). I still have no idea, why we are not allowed to use [official Microsoft C# Naming Conventions (real link)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/coding-style/coding-conventions)

## Stack

Game is written in C# & MonoGame (XNA bulshit and stuff).

Can be built on every platform ([meme.exe](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/7CC2/production/_118283913_29xp-meme-mobilemasterat3x-v3.jpg))
